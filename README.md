# smart-parking-management-system
The aim of this project is to find out if the car park has free slots, or if all of them are complete
by showing multiple free slots at the entrance to the parking. The driver must press Enter button
to open the gate barrier. The barrier arm was removed after parking and the traffic light green
to red again, and the number shown decreased by one. To exit, the driver must press the Exit
button. When the car leaves the number of parking spaces open to it will be reduced by one. If
the parking lot is full, the next entry bar can be closed by pressing the Enter button. Display will change
from welcome to 'please come later, full parking' post.
